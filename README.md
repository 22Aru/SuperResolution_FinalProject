Our final project builds upon the concept of Image Super Resolution.  
Image Super Resolution is the practice of producing a High Resolution Image using Low Resolution Images as the input data.  
For this purpose we will work with the architecture proposed by Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf).  
We will improve the forementioned architecture with the concept of Densely Connected Networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993.pdf).   
We work with the dataset proposed at https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/ .   
We apply different transformations to process said data like cropping.  

Our repostitory contains:  
  ·Our architecture proposed for the task.  
  ·Our dataset constructed to conduct training and testing.  
  ·Our results produced by experimentation (different models and plots).  
  ·This README file.  
Our network is designed to produce an upscaling of x4 to the low resolution image effectively producing a Super Resolution 4 times the low resolution dimensions.
